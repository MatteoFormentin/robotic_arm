# EEZYBOT MK2 Firmware

A firmware for the EEZYBot Mk2 robotic arm by Carlo Franciscone. Implement a serial interface to receive command from any kind of external device. Arm position can be controlled either by providing axis angles or by providing claw pose (the angle are computed with inverse kinematics).
